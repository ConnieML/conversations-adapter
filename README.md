# Twilio Flex 2.0 - LINE Channel

_Twilio Flex 2.0 - LINE Channel_ is a custom channel connector to enable LINE as a conversation channel in Flex 2.0. It uses Twilio Functions as a middleware between [LINE Messaging API](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/) and Twilio Flex.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Obtain LINE Messaging API Channel Credentials

Login to [LINE Developer Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) and create a `LINE - Messaging API Channel`.

You will need the following before proceeding:

1. LINE Channel ID (Under `Basic Settings`)
2. LINE Channel Secret (Under `Basic Settings`)
3. LINE Channel Access Token (Under `Messaging API`)

### Step 2: Create a Twilio Studio Flow

Login to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/) and under `Studio`, create a new Studio Flow.

Within the Studio Flow, drag-and-drop the `Send to Flex` widget and configure the `Workflow` and `Task Channel` accordingly. For `Task Channel`, please choose either `Chat` or `Programmable Chat`.

Once created, connect the `Incoming Conversation` trigger to `Send to Flex` widget and click `Publish`.

The Studio Flow should be configured similar to the screenshot below:

![Flex 2.0 - LINE Channel Studo Flow](docs/flex2_studio_flow.png)

You will need the following before proceeding:

1. Studio Flow SID

### Step 3: Deploy LINE Middleware to Twilio Functions

On your terminal, perform the following:

```
// Clone Project
git clone https://github.com/leroychan/twilio-flex-conversations-line.git

// Change to working directory
cd twilio-flex-conversations-line

// Install NPM Packages
npm install

// Copy sample enviroment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure the `.env` file using your preferred code editor with all the required values obtained from Step 1 and 2. You can leave `ACCOUNT_SID=xxx` and `AUTH_TOKEN=xxx` empty as it will be populated by default during run time.

Once configured and you are ready to deploy it, go back to your terminal and issue the following command:

```
twilio serverless:deploy
```

### Step 4: Configure LINE Messaging API's Webhook

After you have successfully deployed the Twilio Function, copy the the entire API path of `/incoming` and head to [LINE Developer Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) to configure the webhook setting. You can find the webhook setting under `LINE Developer Console > Channel > Messaging API`.

### Step 5: Done !

Congratulations! You are now ready to start testing the LINE integration into Flex 2.0!

Start by logging onto your Flexâ€™s agent interface and try sending a message to your LINE channel. You should see the task coming into Flex!
